# WW3 Stats Viewer

Welcome to the WW3 Stats Utility, a small and quick piece of software made for the game World War 3 (https://worldwar3.com/).
It allows you to display the stats of different guns, display a graph of the damage, and calculate things such as DPS (damage per second), STK (shots to kill) and TTK (Time to kill according to range.

The app was made in python using matplotlib (for charts), tkinter (for UI), and functools (for calculations).

This is only a small proof of concept for some features of an actual website I intend to make. The code is open-source, but it's not that great - I had a hard time using tkinter for my needs and had to use some dirty shortcuts. Let's just say it's not the best code I've written - I'm not particularly good in nor a fan of python.

I hope you enjoy using, and find useful this small utility tool.
